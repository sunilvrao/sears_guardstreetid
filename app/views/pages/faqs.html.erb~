							<div class="panel-body">In short, no.  You should always be cautious about navigating on sites you are not familiar with or that may be considered unsafe.  That also goes for opening emails (the most common source of getting computer viruses) from senders you aren’t familiar with.  There is no such thing as 100% protection.  Guard Street offers a great and tested set of tools to help protect you, but you will still need to use caution and good judgment in your web activity and maintenance of your digital devices.
