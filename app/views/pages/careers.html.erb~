        <h1>Working With Us </h1>

        <p>Most of our candidates can immediately tell on their first interview that this is not your average work
          environment. Sure, we're busy and we work hard, but there's a culture here that just doesn't exist in other
          companies. Everyone knows each other by name. We actually talk to one another. New employees work with senior
          staff members. There's smiles and laughter all the time. Wondering what the difference is? Guard Street is
          made up of a dedicated team of professionals who work together. We enjoy low turnover because here, respect
          and integrity are the solid foundation that our collective success is built on. </p>

        <p>We're big enough to provide amazing jobs and competitive packages, but we're small enough to offer a great
          work environment that is collaborative, innovative and fun. Getting ahead isn't defined by the number of
          useless hours you put in, but by your level of creativity and service to our clients. Our dedicated employees
          move up the ladder fast, and it's not hard to see why.</p>

        <p>All work and no play? NEVER. From outings to the bowling alley, softball at Grant Park, surprise food trucks,
          to friendly competition, we know how to have fun. </p>

        <p>If you're the one that co-workers turn to for input and suggestions, or the person who makes it a point to
          understand the business and aim for improvement, we want you with us. Take a moment to explore our current
          openings and apply if we have an opportunity that's right for you.</p>

        <p>Join one of the hottest consumer companies in Chicago.</p>
