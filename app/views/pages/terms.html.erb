        <a class="anchor" id="b"></a>

        <p>a.	For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Services” shall include, without limitation, our websites, applications, tools, services, materials and content made available to both participants and non-participants alike by GSP.</p>
        <p>b.	The Services provisioned and/or facilitated by us through our Privacy Program consist of a series of third party applications, products and services (collectively, the “Third Party Services”) that we have aggregated, bundled and, where applicable, customized for our participants. We reserve the right to modify, supplement, substitute, suspend, and terminate any Third Party Service and/or Third Party Service provider at any time and in our sole discretion.  As of the date set forth above, the Third Party Services consist of the following:</p>

        <p>c.	After enrolling in our Privacy Program and while using any of the Third Party Services that are offered by us, you shall be subject to the applicable terms of service governing those Third Party Services.  We've provided you, as a convenience, with links to each of the Third Party Services Terms of Use / End User License Agreements (“EULA”) below which are incorporated herein by reference (and we'll endeavor to update these links from time to time).</p>
        <p>d.	We reserve the right to modify, substitute, suspend, and discontinue any Third Party Services at any time and for any reason in our sole discretion.  If you have pre-paid any fees in connection with any Third Party Service that is eliminated by us completely from among the Third Party Services, we will either refund or issue you a credit for the unapplied portion thereof. Except to the extent we are required to refund you any pre-paid fees, we will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification or discontinuance of any products, offerings or services contained within the Services.</p>
        <p>e.	We may offer you access to your credit report, and other credit information, although this service will not be available at all times and in all circumstances. Please understand that we are not a credit repair organization, and are not offering to sell, provide or perform any service to you for the express or implied purpose of either improving your credit record, credit history or credit rating or providing advice or assistance to you with regard to improving your credit record, credit history or credit rating. Accurate adverse information on your credit report cannot be changed. If you believe that your credit report contains inaccurate, non-fraudulent information, it is your responsibility to contact the relevant credit reporting company, and follow the appropriate procedures for notifying the credit reporting company that you believe that your credit report contains an inaccuracy. Any information provided to you regarding the procedures followed by the various credit reporting companies related to the removal of inaccurate, non-fraudulent information is provided without charge to you and is available for free. Any such information is not included as part of your credit score monitoring product but is provided free of charge to all consumers, regardless of whether they are authorized customers/recipients of the credit score monitoring product.</p>
        <a class="anchor" id="c"></a>
        <h2>III. USE OF SERVICES</h2>
        <p>a.	By becoming a participant of our Privacy Program, you will be authorized to enroll in, and use any of the Third Party Services offered by us within the Privacy Program, subject to your satisfaction of the enrollment and service terms and conditions applicable to each, and your continued compliance with these Terms, the requirements appurtenant to both the Privacy Program and each such Service, whether imposed by us or the applicable Third Party Service provider. </p>
        <p>b.	 Without limiting the generality of Section III(a) above, and in consideration of your activation or enrollment in, access to and use of any individual service within the Services (whether provided directly by us or in the form of a Third Party Service), you agree to provide true, accurate, complete and current information about yourself, when prompted to do so by the registration and application forms or as otherwise requested to do so by GSP. By registering, you certify that you are eighteen (18) years of age or older. If any information you provide is untrue, inaccurate or not current, or if we have reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate or not current, then we, at our sole discretion, have the right to suspend or terminate your order of, use of, and/or access to, any of our Services, whether in whole or in part, and refuse all current or future orders of, use of, and/or access to, any Services that we may offer in the future.  Further, you agree that GSP will not be liable to you or any third party if we suspend or terminate your order of, use of, or access to any Services, or any portion thereof, for any reason.</p>
        <p>c.	You understand and agree that by becoming a participant within our Credit Protection Program and enrolling to receive any of the Services that we offer therein, you are expressly providing GSP &quot;written instructions&quot; in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended (&quot;FCRA&quot;), for GSP to obtain information from your personal credit profile from any credit reporting company to verify your identity and to provide credit monitoring, credit reporting, credit scoring, identity monitoring, fraud resolution and card registry products, to the extent offered by GSP through one or more of its Services. Accordingly, you expressly authorize GPS and its service providers to use your social security number to access your personal credit profile, to verify your identity, and to provide credit monitoring, reporting and scoring products.</p>
        <a class="anchor" id="d"></a>
        <h2>IV. RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF SERVICES</h2>
        <p>a.	You will be responsible for all use of the account that will be established for you, and you must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account, or the theft or misplacement of your account number and/or password.</p>
        <p>b.	You may not modify, publish, transmit, display, participate in the transfer or sale, create derivative works, or in any way exploit the Services or any portion of such Services, except as expressly authorized under this Agreement. You may not use any data mining, robots, or similar data gathering and extraction tools within or in connection with the Service, frame any portion of the Services or the content made available thereunder, reproduce, reprint, copy, store, publicly display, broadcast, transmit, modify, translate, port, publish, sublicense, assign, transfer, sell, loan, or otherwise distribute the Services (and the content therein) without our prior written consent. You may not circumvent any mechanisms included in the Services for preventing the unauthorized reproduction or distribution thereof.  Use of the Services in a manner not expressly permitted by this Agreement is a breach of these Terms, will result in the automatic termination of your account and access to the Services, and may violate U.S. or international copyright, trademark, and/or other laws.</p>
        <p>c.	Because the Services include security components, special rules and policies apply. You may not attempt (or support others' attempts) to circumvent, reverse engineer, decrypt, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise alter, tamper or interfere with any aspect of the Services. In addition, you may not attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services or computer systems or networks connected to the Services through hacking, passwords, or data mining, and you may not use bots, spiders or intelligent software. </p>
        <p>d.	The license granted to you hereunder does not convey to you any of the following: (i) reproduction or promotional use rights in the Services, (ii) rights to enter into arrangements with any revenue-generating broadcast system (terrestrial, satellite, cable and/or other distribution channels), (iii) rights to distribute or redistribute the Services on streaming applications (via Internet, intranets and/or other networks), or (iv) commercial, sale, resale, reproduction, distribution or promotional use rights for the Services.</p>
        <p>e.	We make no representations about the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness of the Services or the results to be obtained from using the Services, and you expressly agree that your use of the Services is solely at your own risk. Other than the limited license granted in this Agreement, you have no other rights, title or interest in the Services and/or the software through which the Services are delivered.  Any rights not specifically granted to you by us are fully reserved by us and our licensors, as applicable. Any unauthorized or prohibited use of the Services may subject you to civil liability, criminal prosecution, or both. You understand and acknowledge that in all circumstances your rights with respect to the Services will be limited by applicable laws, by this Agreement and by any Third Party terms of use/EULA. </p>
        <p>f.	Both the Services and our website, mobile website and other properties routinely contain links to external, third party websites and applications. By providing links to other sites/applications, GSP does not guarantee, approve or endorse the information or products available at these sites, nor does a link indicate any association with or endorsement by the linked site to the site in question.  GSP does not operate or control and has no responsibility for the information, products and/or services found on any external sites/applications. Visitors to any GSP properties assume complete responsibility and risk in their use of any external sites. Visitors should direct any concerns regarding any external link to the site administrator.</p>
        <a class="anchor" id="e"></a>
        <h2>V.  PAYMENT TERMS</h2>
        <p>a.	Your participation in our Privacy Program is fixed for a period of one calendar year starting on the day you join, although you'll have the option to pay fees annually, quarterly or on a monthly basis.  Your Privacy Program account will be considered activated upon our receipt of the first payment due.</p>
        <p>b.	Payments can be made by credit card or direct debit. </p>
        <p>c.	It is your responsibility to advise GSP of your intention not to renew. We reserve the right to automatically charge your credit card or direct debit and continue on the same terms and in the same amount as was in place immediately prior to your renewal, subject to standard rate increases implemented by GSP, unless you've notified us of your intention to terminate your Privacy Program account or to modify the Services you're receiving commencing on your renewal date. </p>
        <p>d.	To cancel your Privacy Program you will need to notify us in writing or speak with an authorized representative by contacting our customer service department through either the Support Page or the Manage My Account page on our website, or by calling the toll free number provided on our website. Refunds will not be given upon the termination of your Privacy Program account/service unless such termination occurs within thirty (30) days from either the commencement of your service or any annual renewal period.</p>
        <p>e.   You may upgrade the Services you receive from GSP at any time, whether by adding individual services, products or mini-packages (e.g., Third Party Services) that we offer, or by subscribing to a higher level Service program (i.e., upgrading from Pro to Premium). In the event you choose to add an individual service, product or mini-package, then that service shall run under its own contract term.  If, however, you shall choose to upgrade your full Service program, then your annual, quarterly or monthly commitment shall begin anew from your enrollment date within the higher-level program.  The foregoing notwithstanding, GSP reserves the right to refuse your upgrade if you are not in good standing at the time of your upgrade request as determined by GSP in its sole discretion.</p>
        <p>f.   If you shall desire to downgrade the Services you previously purchased from GSP,  you may only do so at the beginning of the next contract year if paying annually or the next month if paying monthly unless you receive authorized written approval from GSP therefore, which GSP shall grant in its sole discretion.  Solely in the case of a mid-year downgrade that has been approved by GSP in which you pre-paid the annual fees for the entire year, upon executing and processing the downgrade you shall receive a credit for the difference in fees between the Services for the remainder of your plan, which may only be applied to future Services / enrollment fees. The foregoing notwithstanding, GSP reserves the right to refuse your downgrade if you are not in good standing at the time of your request as determined by GSP in its sole discretion.</p>
          <a class="anchor" id="f"></a>
        <h2>VI. UNSOLICITED MATERIALS; USER LICENSE</h2>
        <p>In operating, provisioning and facilitating the Services, any information or material submitted or sent to GSP will not be treated as confidential or secret, save certain transaction information.  In addition to the foregoing, by communicating with GSP and submitting or sending content, materials, drawings, ideas, concepts, designs, or information in any format now existing or hereafter devised (the “User Content”), you are granting GSP a royalty-free, unrestricted, world-wide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive and fully sub-licensable right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such User Content (in whole or part).</p>

        <p>a.	From time to time, we will make software (i.e., apps, programs, etc.) available for you in connection with the Services we provide, whether integrated therein, independent or otherwise. Such software will be subject to this Agreement, and if applicable, the terms of the license agreement that accompanies it.

You agree to abide by all laws and regulations in effect regarding your use of the software. You may not authorize or assist any third party to do any of the things prohibited in this Section VIII.  We may automatically check your version of the software and update it to improve its performance and capabilities.

        <p>c.	APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
        <a class="anchor" id="i"></a>
        <p>X.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY<br>
          IN NO EVENT WILL GSP, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SPONSORS, SUPPLIERS/THIRD PARTY LICENSORS, ADVERTISERS, PARENTS, AFFILIATES, SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNS, BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY (i) FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE AVAILABILITY, USE, RELIANCE ON, OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, EVEN IF GSP OR ITS AGENTS SHALL HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE; (ii) FOR ANY LIABILITIY OR HARM ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF ANY REFERRAL; OR (iii) FOR ANY CLAIM ATTRIBUTABLE TO ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR OTHER INACCURACIES IN ANY OF THE SERVICES.

        <a class="anchor" id="j"></a>
        <h2>XI.  INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
        <p>Upon a request by GSP, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold GSP, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, suppliers and representatives harmless from any and all claims, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising in any way from your use or misuse of the Services or any violation of these Terms by you. GSP reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with GSP in asserting any available defense.</p>
        <h2>XII.	IMAGE TERMS OF USE; COPYRIGHTS AND COPYRIGHT AGENT</h2>

        <p>We will respond expeditiously to claims of copyright infringement committed using the Services that are reported to the above-referenced Designated Copyright Agent in accordance with the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (“DMCA”) or, as applicable, other laws. With respect to the Services hosted in the United States, these notices must include the required information set forth in the DMCA, which includes without limitation:</p>
        <ul>

          <li>Identification of the copyrighted work(s) that you claim has been infringed; </li>
          <li>A description of the material that you claim is infringing and the location of that material on the Site; </li>

        <h2>XIV. REMEDIES</h2>
