        <h1>Guard Street Story</h1>
        <p>The world we live in today can be scary.  The number of victims of cybercrime and ID theft is growing drastically worldwide and the average financial loss is now in the thousands per victim and rising.  Fraudsters, criminals, hackers and marketers are steps ahead in using online devices to collect personal data.  It's incredibly easy to become a victim these days if you use a mobile device, tablet, laptop or desktop to social network, shop and bank online.  Saving files, sending emails, carrying a wallet or purse and even a luggage tag isn't safe anymore.  Plus, free or cheap email comes at a price.  You pay for it with your data being sold or being subjected to unwanted advertisements all the time. </p>
        <p>Our co-founders are big time advocates for protecting data security and consumer privacy BEFORE there is a problem. But to do that, you need to have the right system and tools in place. </p>
        <p>Our ultimate goal was to create a virtual community that's safe for our users. We started by doing our homework on the tools available in the marketplace and created something better &#8212; an all in one personal data locking system that you can use everywhere to save you time and money.  It went like this...</p>
        <ol>
          <li>We identified which consumers are the target and when they are vulnerable.</li>
          <li>We determined what <strong>needs</strong> to be in packages to get all around protection.</li>
          <li>We did our homework and found that some of our customers' data needed to be stored in a safer place. This data is stored on secure servers in Switzerland.</li>
          <li>We tested the tools and continue to re-test all the time so our customers get the most advanced protection in their peer group. </li>
          <li>We realized many customer's needs may be unique, so we created a portfolio of packages as well as a la carte items for a truly customized solution.</li>
        </ol>
        <a class="anchor" id="a"></a>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Protect our customers' privacy, personal data, and anonymity while they make purchases, bank, navigate the internet, travel and live their life every day. </p>
        <a class="anchor" id="b"></a>
        <h2>Our Customer Commitment &#8212; We will never sell your data to advertisers.</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Most Complete Privacy Offering</strong> &#8211; Our holistic approach provides online protection when you're navigating, social networking, communicating, storing data, shopping, banking and traveling.  All in one place, using any device.</li>
          <li><strong>Best In Class</strong> &#8211; We take the guesswork out and have done the homework so your package includes many of the top tools available in each aspect of your locking system.</li>
          <li><strong>Best Value</strong> &#8211; One package, and a whole lot of big savings</li>
        </ul>
